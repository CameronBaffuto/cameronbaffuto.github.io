    <p>Want to adopt a Basset from rescue? Suncoast has been fortunate to place our Bassets in wonderful homes in different areas of Florida. If you live out of State,
        we urge you to get in touch with your local rescue or the closest one and apply through their organization first. Suncoast is glad to offer you a referral for
        your nearest Basset rescue organization, but we suggest you check with the Daily Drool for a comprehensive list of rescue organizations. Most rescues will encourage
        you to support and adopt from your local or state rescue organization. Suncoast Basset Rescue, Inc. covers the entire State of Florida.</p>

    <p>In order to adopt a Basset Hound from Suncoast you must first fill out a fully completed application form. This will enable us to help speed along the adoption process,
        and in order to do that you can either send in your application online or by mail.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><a href="../adoptionApplication/adoptionApplication.html">Click here</a> to fill out a Suncoast Adoption Application online, please remember to keep a copy of your application
    for your records. If you would like to copy and paste the form into a Word document you can then fill it out, print and mail to Suncoast:</p>

    <p class="text-center">Suncoast Basset Rescue, Inc.</p>
    <p class="text-center">4142 Mariner Blvd #305</p>
    <p class="text-center">Spring Hill, FL 34609</p>
    <p class="text-center">(352) 371-8082</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Once we have received your completed adoption application we will review all information. Any references given may be contacted to verify any information regarding past or present
        animals that the potential adopter has owned. If you are renting your home, you must show proof that the landlord has given permission for a dog to be at your premises.</p>

    <p>Suncoast will contact you as quickly as possible once we have received your adoption application. However, please be patient since we are 100% volunteer and most of us have full time jobs.
        We ask that you understand we do our best to get in contact with you as soon as possible. Suncoast reserves the right to deny or accept applications, and we will notify you of our final
        decision as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Suncoast also reserves the right to conduct a home check regarding your adoption application. This is a required part of the adoption process, and is a way for our volunteers to get to know you,
        your family and any existing pets. We can sometimes bring the pet you are interested in along with us for you to meet if they are in the same geographic location as you.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Suncoast relies on a working relationship with you to find out which pet will most suit your home. We always ask that you notify us of your interest in any Basset that we have. We will put you in contact
        with the foster home to determine if this pet would be a good match for your home and family. Once the right Basset has been found for you, Suncoast will then facilitate the adoption through your local adoption
        coordinator. If the Basset is not located in your geographic area then Suncoast will work with you to make arrangements to get the Basset as close to you as possible. You may be asked to drive within a reasonable
        distance to pick up your Basset if it is not located in your area. Suncoast has a wonderful group of volunteers who offer their time to help transport the Bassets to their new homes.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>Once you have found your Basset you will then formally adopt the Basset. Suncoast will ask that you fill out the adoption agreement and any needed paperwork. The adoption agreement requires that the adopter will agree to the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Provide adequate food, fresh water, shelter, exercise, veterinary care and yearly inoculations for as recommended by attending veterinarian, and license said dog according to local and state laws</li>
        <li>Contact Suncoast in the event of the Basset becoming lost or stolen.</li>
        <li>Contact Suncoast if the adopter decides to relinquish the dog, and only turn it back in to Suncoast.</li>
        <li>Not tie or chain the dog.</li>
        <li>Not relinquish ownership of dog to any other person or entity without first obtaining the written permission and agreement of Suncoast Basset Rescue, Inc. The rescue Basset may not be transferred to any other person, firm, corporation or organization for any reason.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Suncoast considers this a binding contractual agreement between the two parties. Once a dog has been adopted Suncoast reserves the rights to periodically check up on the Basset. We ask that you please consider the financial obligations of adopting a pet for the rest of their lifetime.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Suncoast asks that you make a tax-deductible donation at the time of the adoption. Adoption donations for Bassets under 1 years old require a $300 donation, and bassets between the ages of 1 and 8 require a $225 donation unless otherwise specified prior to the adoption. Adoption donations for
        seniors (age 9 and older) are $100, and at times Suncoast will waive all donations for seniors so please check with your adoption coordinator regarding a certain dog. Adoption donations for Special Needs Bassets will be determined on a case-by-case basis, but normally will be $100 unless otherwise specified or waived.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Bonded pairs $300</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Adoption donations for Special Needs Bassets and Special Situations Bassets will be determined on a case-by-case basis.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Suncoast will provide you with copies of your paperwork, and any information that we have regarding the Basset you adopted. We will be available to you for questions about your new Basset, and we will consider the Basset successfully adopted once all of the above is finalized. To many, this may seem like a long process
        to get your dog, but it is not necessarily true. We do put a lot of effort into each of our Bassets because the goal of our rescue is to spend the time and effort necessary to put the dog in their final and forever home. Many of the Bassets we help have had rough lives, and we do everything possible to make sure they are
        going to what we hope to be their forever home. Thank you for considering to adopt from Suncoast.</p>
